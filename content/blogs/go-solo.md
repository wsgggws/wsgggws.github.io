This is very beautiful song named "go solo", I live it.

They say it's a matter of time

a thousand days and the sun won't shine

before I come back to you

And I'm happy, nothins going to stop me

I'm making my way home

I am making my way

For your love I will go far

I wanna be wherever you are

I know I'm coming back for you

Our love is a river long
